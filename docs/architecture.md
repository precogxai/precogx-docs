## 🎯 Decision-Making Logic

The core intelligence of PrecogX lies in its ability to decide what to do when it detects a potential threat. This decision is made in milliseconds by evaluating two key factors: the **Agent's Trust Score** and the **Detection's Severity**.

### **The Three Tiers of Response:**

#### 1. **PREVENT (Auto-Block)**
- **Trigger**: Unambiguously malicious or high-risk events
- **Examples**: Critical prompt injections, detected malicious code execution, actions by quarantined agents
- **Action**: Instantly blocks the action before execution
- **Value**: Immediate, real-time protection against severe threats

#### 2. **HOLD FOR HUMAN (Active Intervention)**
- **Trigger**: Situations too risky to allow automatically but not definitively malicious
- **Examples**: Lower agent Trust Score + medium-to-high severity detection
- **Action**: Pauses action and waits for human decision via Slack/Teams
- **Value**: Brings expert human judgment to ambiguous, high-stakes situations

#### 3. **DETECT & ALLOW (Passive Monitoring)**
- **Trigger**: Trusted agent with low-to-medium severity detection
- **Action**: Allows action to proceed, logs event for auditing
- **Value**: Complete audit trail without interrupting safe workflows

## 🎯 Conclusion

The **Layered Security Architecture** provides enterprise-grade AI security through intelligent automation and human oversight. This approach delivers:

- **Maximum Security**: Multi-layer threat detection and prevention
- **Operational Efficiency**: 95% automated decisions
