# Real-Time AI Prevention

PrecogX provides **microsecond-level real-time interception** and prevention capabilities that act as an AI firewall, blocking malicious actions before they can execute. This comprehensive security layer works across all integration methods - from SDK to no-code platforms.

## 🚀 What is Real-Time Prevention?

Real-Time Prevention is PrecogX's core capability that **intercepts AI agent actions before execution** and makes instant ALLOW/BLOCK decisions based on security policies. Unlike traditional monitoring that detects threats after they occur, PrecogX prevents threats from happening in the first place.

### Key Characteristics

- **⚡ Sub-100ms Response Times**: All validation decisions complete within 100 milliseconds
- **🛡️ Pre-Execution Interception**: Actions are validated before they execute
- **🎯 Function-Level Security**: Every function call can be intercepted and validated
- **🔄 Real-Time Decision Making**: Instant ALLOW/BLOCK responses from backend
- **🌐 Universal Integration**: Works across SDK, HTTP API, and no-code platforms

## ⚡ Microsecond-Level Performance

### Response Time Breakdown

| Validation Step | Time | Description |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| **Agent Quarantine Check** | ~5ms | Single database query for agent status |
| **Function Policy Check** | ~1ms | In-memory lookup of disallowed functions |
| **Shell Command Check** | ~10ms | Pattern matching for dangerous commands |
| **Privilege Check** | ~5ms | Context-based permission validation |
| **File Operation Check** | ~5ms | Pattern matching for dangerous file ops |
| **Network Overhead** | ~50ms | HTTP request/response latency |
| **Total Response Time** | **<100ms** | Complete validation cycle |

### Performance Optimizations

- **In-Memory Security Rules**: Function blacklists and patterns stored in memory
- **Optimized Database Queries**: Single-query agent status checks

## 🛡️ Security Validation Rules

PrecogX applies comprehensive security rules during real-time validation to prevent various types of threats.

### Function-Level Protection

**Disallowed Functions**:
- System execution functions (`exec_shell`, `os.system`, `subprocess.run`)
- Code evaluation functions (`eval`, `exec`, `compile`)
- Import manipulation (`__import__`, `globals`, `locals`)

**Protection Scope**:
- Function name validation
- Argument pattern analysis
- Context-aware permission checks
- Tool call validation

### Command-Level Protection

**Dangerous Shell Patterns**:
- File system destruction (`rm -rf`, `del /s`)
- System shutdown commands (`shutdown`, `reboot`)
- Process termination (`kill -9`, `taskkill`)
- Disk formatting (`format`)

**Protection Scope**:
- Command argument analysis
- Pattern matching against known threats
- Context-based privilege validation
- Multi-platform command detection

### Context-Aware Security

**Validation Context**:
- User roles and permissions
- Environment settings (production/staging)
- Session information
- Agent metadata

**Dynamic Rules**:
- Role-based access control
- Environment-specific policies
- Session-based restrictions
- Agent-specific configurations
