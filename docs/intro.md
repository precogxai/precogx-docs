# Welcome to PrecogX

**AI-native cybersecurity for the modern world**

PrecogX is a next-generation SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platform designed specifically for AI agents and agentic systems. Our platform provides real-time threat detection, incident response, and human-in-the-loop validation to secure your AI operations at scale.

## What is PrecogX?

PrecogX intercepts dangerous AI agent actions in real time — blocking threats like prompt injection, credential theft, and data exfiltration before they execute, with a clear, auditable explanation of exactly what was detected and why.

Unlike monitoring tools that alert you after the damage is done, PrecogX acts as a pre-execution firewall. Every agent action is validated before it runs. Every block is explained. Every decision is logged with full context so your team can audit, review, and improve over time.

PrecogX protects against:

- **Prompt Injection** — Attackers embedding instructions inside user input to hijack your agent's behavior
- **PII & Credential Leakage** — Sensitive data (SSNs, credit cards, API keys, passwords) leaving your system in agent responses or tool calls
- **Tool Abuse & SSRF** — Agents attempting destructive commands, unauthorized file operations, or access to internal network endpoints
- **Behavioral Drift** — Agents deviating from their established behavior patterns in ways that signal compromise or misuse
- **Content Violations** — Outputs containing profanity, hate speech, or policy-violating material before they reach end users

## Key Features

### 🛡️ **Pre-Execution Firewall**
Every agent action is validated before it runs. 6 detection modules — prompt injection (130+ patterns), PII leakage, tool abuse + SSRF, malicious links, content moderation, and behavioral drift — compound their signals and return a clear ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK verdict to your SDK in under 100ms.

### 📊 **Dynamic Trust Scoring**
Adaptive trust scoring that learns from your agents' behavior patterns and threat landscape.

### 👥 **Human-in-the-Loop Validation**
Advanced validation system for uncertain cases with team collaboration and approval workflows.

### 🔗 **Framework Integrations**
Seamless integration with LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, and other popular AI frameworks.

### 🔔 **Smart Notifications**
Configurable alerts with digest mode, severity filtering, and mute controls to reduce notification fatigue.

### ⚡ **Automated Response**
Intelligent blocking and escalation based on risk scores with environment-based detection thresholds.
