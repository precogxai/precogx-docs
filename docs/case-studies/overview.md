# Case Studies

Real-world applications of PrecogX across industries deploying AI agents at scale.

AI agents are increasingly autonomous — they write emails, execute code, call APIs, access databases, and manage workflows without a human in the loop. This power introduces a new attack surface: adversarial inputs that hijack agent behavior, data leakage through poorly bounded tool access, and behavioral drift that goes undetected until damage is done.

These case studies explore how organizations in different sectors use PrecogX to secure their AI agent deployments.
