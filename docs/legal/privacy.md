# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 1, 2026**

PrecogX ("PrecogX," "we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and safeguard information when you use the PrecogX website, platform, APIs, SDK, and related services (collectively, the "Services").

**The short version:** We process your AI agent telemetry data to detect threats and protect your systems. We do not sell your data. We do not use your data to train our AI models.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### Account and Identity Data
When you register for PrecogX, we collect:
- Email address and name
- Organization name and billing information
- Authentication credentials (stored as hashed values — never in plaintext)

### Telemetry and Agent Data
When your AI agents send data to PrecogX, we process:
- **Prompts and responses:** The text inputs and outputs of your AI agents, analyzed for threats
- **Tool call payloads:** Parameters and results of function calls made by your agents
- **Agent metadata:** Agent IDs, session identifiers, timestamps, and event types
- **Behavioral signals:** Patterns of tool usage, response frequency, and workflow sequences

This data is used exclusively to detect threats, calculate trust scores, and provide the security insights shown in your dashboard.

### Usage and Analytics Data
We collect anonymized, aggregated usage information such as:
- Feature engagement (e.g., which dashboard views are visited)
- API request volume and response times
- Error rates and system health metrics

This data does not contain personally identifiable information or Customer Data content.

---

## 2. AI Training and Data Privacy

**PrecogX does NOT use your AI agent data — including prompts, responses, tool calls, or any Customer Data — to train or improve our threat detection models.**

Our detection models are trained on:
- Synthetic datasets generated internally
- Publicly available threat intelligence and security research
- Anonymized, aggregated statistical patterns with no customer-identifiable content

Customer data is used solely to analyze threats within your environment. Our models are isolated so that data from one customer cannot influence outcomes for another.

---

## 3. How We Use Your Information

| Data Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Account data | Authentication, billing, and support |
| Telemetry data | Real-time threat detection, trust scoring, and security alerts |
| Usage analytics | Platform reliability, performance optimization, and product improvement |

We do not use your data for advertising, profiling beyond security analytics, or any purpose not described in this policy.

---

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion

We follow a minimal retention approach:

- **Active telemetry:** Agent interaction logs are stored for up to **90 days** for trend analysis, trust scoring, and incident investigation
- **Aggregated metrics:** Anonymized statistical summaries (e.g., monthly event counts) are retained indefinitely for billing and reporting purposes
- **Account data:** Retained for the duration of your subscription plus 30 days after cancellation to allow for account recovery
- **On deletion:** When you delete your account, all telemetry data, agent records, and detection results are permanently and irreversibly deleted within 30 days

You may request earlier deletion of your data by contacting **hello@precogx.ai**.

---

## 5. Data Sharing

**We do not sell your data to anyone.**

We may share your information only in the following limited circumstances:

- **Within PrecogX:** Authorized personnel who need access to provide, secure, and maintain the Services
- **Service providers:** Third-party infrastructure providers (e.g., cloud hosting, database services) bound by strict data processing agreements that prohibit them from using your data for any purpose other than providing services to us
- **Legal requirements:** When required by law, court order, or regulatory obligation, after making reasonable efforts to notify you (where legally permitted)
- **Business transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your data will be transferred subject to the same privacy protections described in this policy, and you will be notified in advance

We do not share raw telemetry data, prompts, or agent responses with third parties for any commercial purpose.

---

## 6. Data Security

We implement enterprise-grade security measures to protect your data:

- **Encryption in transit:** All data transmitted between your systems and PrecogX is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher
- **Encryption at rest:** All stored data is encrypted using AES-256
- **Access controls:** Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts production data access to authorized personnel only
- **API security:** All API requests require valid API keys transmitted over HTTPS; keys are stored as hashed values
- **Infrastructure:** Services are hosted on SOC 2-compliant cloud infrastructure with regular security audits

No security system is impenetrable. If we become aware of a security breach affecting your data, we will notify you in accordance with applicable law.

---
