## 6. Intellectual Property Rights

All rights, title, and interest in and to the Services — including software, AI models, threat detection algorithms, GLSL shaders, dashboard interfaces, API schemas, and documentation — are and remain the exclusive property of PrecogX or its licensors. Nothing in these Terms transfers any intellectual property rights to you, except the limited license to use the Services as described herein.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services without PrecogX's prior written consent.
